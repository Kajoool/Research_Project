## Introduction
Lung cancer is now one of the deadliest cancers worldwide. However, the early detection of lung cancer significantly improves survival rate. Various diagnostic procedures are used by physicians, in connection, for the early diagnosis of malignant lung nodules, such as clinical settings, computed tomography (CT) scan analysis (morphological assessment), positron emission tomography (PET) (metabolic assessments), and needle prick biopsy analysis . However, mostly invasive methods such as biopsies or surgeries are used by healthcare practitioners to differentiate between benign and malignant lung nodules. The earlier the detection, the higher is the possibility of successful treatment This accounts for an expected 9.6 million passing or one of every six deaths from last three years. To be precise lung cancer represents 2.06 million cases and 1.76 million passing. Cancer cells can be carried away from lungs in blood, or lymph fluid that surrounds lung tissue. Lymph streams through lymphatic vessels, which drain into lymph nodes placed in lungs and in centre of the chest. Lung cancer often spreads towards the centre of chest as it is the natural flow of lymph. Cancer that initiates in lungs is known as primary lung cancer. There are multiple types of lung cancer and further they are separated in two main groups: small cell lung cancer and non-small lung cancer. An estimate of lung cancer found in males and in females due to smoking is 85% and 75% respectively. 

The method of early detection of cancer plays a crucial role to prevent cancer cells from multiplying and spreading. Previous researchers have been conducted for analysing lung cancer using clustering method in microarray data, lung cancer detection with general image processing techniques in CT scan data with good accuracy and results. In the first phase I get CT scan image data. Further I implemented image enhancement to improve quality of image. The third step is image segmentation which is vital step for detection of cancer. The fourth phase is feature extraction that will give a conclusion whether lung cancer is present or not.

Visually identifying and examining these images for potential abnormalities is a challenging and time consuming task due to the large amount of information that needs to be processed, and the short amount of time given. The subject of medical image mining is currently an up and coming topic and shows a lot of research potential in the area of computational intelligence. By auto-analysing a patientâ€™s records and images through image processing techniques, we would reduce the risk of human error in nodule detection. By applying a combination of techniques in data pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification, we ultimately seek to increase the accuracy rate of cancer detection, while simultaneously reducing the false positive diagnosis rate. Many researchers proposed many solutions and challenges of different phases of computer aided system to detect the lung cancer in early stages and give the facts about the lung cancer. CV (Computer Vision) play vital role to prevent lung cancer.
